Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
                The dataset consists of various attributes related to individuals' educational background, skills, and job details.

                The objective of this analysis is to clean the dataset and perform univariate and bivariate analysis to gain insights into the relationship between various features and the target variable, which is Salary. We will visualize the data using both visual and non-visual techniques and make observations for each plot. This will help us understand the data better and derive meaningful insights that can be used for further analysis or decision-making.
